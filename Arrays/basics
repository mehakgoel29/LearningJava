arrays are collection of homogenous data .
datatype arr[]-> this declaration happens at compile time .
new datatype[size]->this happens at runtime.

array objects are stored in heap.
heap objects are not continuous.

array objects in java may not be continuous and it depends on JVM.
indexes start from 0.
"new" keyword is used to crreate an object in heap memory.

"null" is a special type of literal that can only be assigned to a non-primitive datatype but not to a primitive one.
"null" is a special literal that represents the absence of a value or reference.
It is used to indicate that a variable does not currently point to any object or value.
literal:- a literal is a fixed value that is directly written into the code
int x = 42;   // Decimal literal
String s = "Hello, World!";  // String literal
String str = null; // Null literal

primitive datatype cannot be further divided and it doesnot depends upon objects.
primitives are stored in stack memory and all other like strings type ,array type are stored in heap memory


strings are immutable in java -> cannot be changed 
arrays are mutable in java -> can be changed 

In java there is only pass by value 

/***********************************************2D ARRAY*****************************************************/

.length in 2d array give number of rows 
int [][] arr=new int[3][4] -> it will return 3 when arr.length is used 

2D arrays in Java can be visualized as arrays of arrays, where each individual index holds a reference to an array.
You can iterate through array elements using a traditional for loop, an enhanced for-each loop,
or utilize the `Arrays.toString()` method for simple printing.
