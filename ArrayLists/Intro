Java ArrayList is a part of the Java collections framework and it is a class of java.util package.
It provides us with dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can 
be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed. 
The main advantage of ArrayList in Java is, that if we declare an array then we need to mention the size, 
but in ArrayList,it is not needed to mention the size of ArrayList. If you want to mention the size then you can do it.

syntax:
ArrayList<datatype> list = new ArrayList<>(initialCapacity);
