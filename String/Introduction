STRING
An immutable class that creates new objects when modified, which can consume memory and slow execution. 
Strings are useful when strings aren't frequently modified, and can make code easier to read and
understand for simple string operations. However, string manipulation like concatenation and substring 
can generate a lot of garbage in the heap.

STRINGBUILDER
A mutable class that can modify a single string without creating additional objects.
This makes StringBuilder more efficient for frequent string modification, large string construction,
and performance optimization. StringBuilder provides methods like append(), insert(), delete(), and substring() 
for string manipulation.
